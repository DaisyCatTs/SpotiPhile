## Abrupt-session resume and history safety

Upstream: `f5a946c6bb1b332a1147153821172cf08eb84d30` (Spotifast #727).
Port commit: `48801ff` on feature/upstream-safety, preserving Dennis's authorship.
Applied without source adaptations. Track changes mark the session dirty and
active playback refreshes resume state every 30 seconds. History uses a synced
temporary file and atomic replacement; failed writes remain dirty for retry.
JSON formats, credentials, queue behavior, audio and appearance are unchanged.

Regression coverage includes periodic resume saving, whole-file replacement,
failed-write retry, and Unix owner-only permissions. Branch-specific validation
and protected CI must pass before promotion. Unix behavior requires platform CI;
a Windows run does not validate Unix filesystem behavior.

Future entries must record source SHA, author, purpose, adaptations, port commit,
verification and any platform or performance limitations.
